**Frequency**: Monthly (first week)
**Time Required**: 3 minutes
**Priority**: High (required for accounting)

---

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Starting Point**: Bluejet Dashboard (home screen after login)

**Steps:**

1. **Navigate to Reports Section**
   - Click: "Reports" in left sidebar
   - Location: Left side, below "Dashboard", above "Settings"
   - Visual Cue: Chart/graph icon (blue)

2. **Select Report Type**
   - Click: "Sales Reports" tab at top
   - Location: Top horizontal menu, second tab

3. **Configure Report Parameters**
   - Date Range: Click calendar icon, select "Last Month" from dropdown
   - Format: Select "Excel (.xlsx)" from format dropdown
   - Grouping: Check box for "Group by Product Category"
   - Details: Check box for "Include Customer Details"

4. **Generate Report**
   - Click: "Generate Report" button (green, bottom right)
   - Wait: Progress bar appears (usually 10-30 seconds)

5. **Download**
   - Click: "Download" button when it appears
   - File: Saves to Downloads folder automatically
   - Filename format: SalesReport_YYYY-MM.xlsx

---

### Success Indicators

**You know it worked when:**
- ✅ Green checkmark appears with "Report generated successfully"
- ✅ Download starts automatically (check Downloads folder)
- ✅ Excel file opens and shows data (50-200 rows typical)
- ✅ Filename matches current month (e.g., SalesReport_2026-01.xlsx)

---

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue 1**: "No data available for selected period"
- **Cause**: Date range selected before business started or future dates
- **Solution**: Double-check date range, ensure "Last Month" is selected

**Issue 2**: Download button doesn't appear
- **Cause**: Report still generating (large dataset)
- **Solution**: Wait 30 more seconds. If still nothing, refresh page and try again

**Issue 3**: Excel file won't open
- **Cause**: File corrupted or Excel not installed
- **Solution**: Try downloading again, or open in Google Sheets instead

---

### Pro Tips

💡 **Shortcut**: Bookmark this report! Click star icon next to "Sales Reports" tab. Next time: Dashboard → Bookmarks → Monthly Sales

💡 **Time Saver**: Set up automated email delivery: Click "Schedule" button instead of "Generate" - report emails you automatically first Monday of month

💡 **Watch Out For**: Always verify the month! Easy to accidentally run last year's report. Check the date range before clicking Generate.

💡 **Related Tasks**: After downloading, upload to Google Drive (Finance folder) and send to accountant Petra
